# node-test
Node js test from Virtusa

## Requirements

- Node.js 10 (recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to be able to switch node versions easy) 

Installing node packages and serving the development server:

- Run `npm install` in parent path
- Run `npm run start` for a dev server. 
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will not be reloaded automatically if you change any of the source files since nodemon not installed.
Following APIs used in the applications:
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/parse
  http://localhost:3000/api/v2/parse
